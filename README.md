## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide more information about temperature trends to determine if opening a surf shop and ice cream shop is a good idea.  Specifically, we are analyzing temperature data from the months of June and December in Oahu.  The goal of this analysis is to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
The below results highlight three key differences in weather between June and December.
1. June temperatures are approximately four degrees warmer than December temperatures.
2. While the average temperatures don't vary greatly between the two months, the minimum temperatures are quite different.  December's minimum temperature of 56 feels quite different than June's minimum temperature of 64.
3. June has approximately 200 more data points collected than December even though December has one more day.  This means that data collection is not consistent across the multiple stations and dates.

## Summary
While June and December have similar  average temperatures, December has a much greater range in temperature.  Additional queries  that would be helpful to perform to gather more weather date for June and December include analyzing precipitation  in the two months as well as analysis on when that precipitation occurs. Even if the weather is warm, rainy weather isn't always conducive to surfing and ice cream. Even though it may rain everyday if it typically rains in the late evening after dark, the amount of precipitation most likely won't affect shop sales.
